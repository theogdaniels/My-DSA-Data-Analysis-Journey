# My_DSA_Data_Analysis_Journey

### Porfolio Building
**On Porfolio Building**

Here at DSA (Digital SKills Africa) was where I began to know and learn about portfolio building. Having had classes with DSA on data analysis. I have learnt to use analytic programmees like Excel, SQL (Structured Query Language) and the Power BI. It was fun learning and an insightful journey.

### Project Topic

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is the Amazon Case Study.xlsx and the KMS Sql Case Study.xlsx and this data was provided me by the Incubator Hub facilitator. I believe it is an open source data that can be gotten for free from online sites that provides data. Sites such as kaggle, FRED etc
